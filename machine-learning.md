### Learning from Data: Part II 

## Machine Learning
  
**hello** is a minimalist template that lets you design a beautiful website or portfolio on GitHub Pages - without installing a Ruby
development environment, learning to use Jekyll, **or even typing a single line of code**. It's ideal for GitHubbers
who want to start building their personal website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but maybe aren't so familiar with web development.
  

The default layout of **hello** is a streamlined single page with three major customizable sections: a required "about" section, an optional portfolio, and an optional CTA. Using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) variables declared by in the config and index files, **hello** offers an easy-to-use design where all customizations necessary for a basic personal website can be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  


**hello** is adapted from [Twenty](https://html5up.net/twenty), a responsive, mobile-friendly theme by HTML5 Up.
